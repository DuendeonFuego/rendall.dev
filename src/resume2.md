## Experience
### rendall.tv 
#### Principal Software Developer 
#### 6.2002 - Present
rendall.tv is the kitchen-sink rubric under which I freelance, having built such diverse projects as websites, online reservation systems, SMS messaging applications, Facebook applications, physical interactive kiosks, content management systems, online payments, and more. Currently, I'm building an interactive guide for the Burning Man festival and, more broadly, city-wide events.

Security was of special concern here due to the sensitive nature of the data entrusted to our care. Loyalistic is a software development company specializing in SaaS consulting based in Helsinki.

## Volunteer
### Disorient Event Producer, Creative Technologist, Art Director 2009 - Present
I have been involved in Disorient at all levels, as all Disorienters eventually come to be, from heading up massive events of 1500+ attendees, creating and managing art projects, and of course hauling equipment and cleaning floors. Disorient's organization is itself an aesthetic experiment: amorphous and constantly changing, by design. Members do whatever is necessary, coming together to form ad-hoc teams called cells, that form as needed and disperse when completed. No role is too small or too big for a true Disorienter. Disorient is a sound, visual and performance art collective which produces events as an art form. Over time, it has developed a distinctive aesthetic (called "GlamTech") and even its own color scheme (called "Pornj" which is a color combining pink and orange).
