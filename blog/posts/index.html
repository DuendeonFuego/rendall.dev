    <article> <p>Happy Holidays, everyone. I just launched this blog right into the holiday season, and so start with a gap! I hope your holidays are going well.</p>

    <h2><a href="/posts/2018/12/21/database-vocabulary-acid/" class="postlist-link">Database vocabulary: ACID</a></h2>
    <time class="postlist-date" datetime="2018.12.21">2018-12-21</time>
    <article> <p>Databases are often described in terms of their ACID properties (e.g. &quot;eventual consistency&quot;), so knowing the vocabulary is useful when considering a database solution. Some contemporary database management systems intentionally disregard ACID properties in a tradeoff for other gains.</p>
<p><em><strong>ACID</strong></em> is an acronym representing four traits of a database transaction that will guarantee valid data even if the transaction is not completed. Transactions that violate these principles will leave the database in an unknown or invalid state.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomicity</strong>: a transaction must either complete all operations of the transaction or no operations.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: a transaction that completes must conform to all and any constraints on the data.
<ul>
<li><em>eventual consistency</em>: in a distributed database, a change to the data in one instance will take time to propogate to other instances. Eventual consistency means that this change will eventually propogate (&quot;converge&quot;), and all relational constraints and rules will be applied; but before then, anything goes: old, invalid date might be retrieved instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: a transaction's operations must not influence (be visible to) other transactions until the transaction is complete. Rather, transactions executed at the same time must behave as if they were executed one at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong>: the changes made by a completed transaction must be permanent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The influential paper describing these properties is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810141540/https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs340v/papers/recovery.pdf">&quot;Principles of Transaction-Oriented Database Recovery&quot;</a> by Haerder and Reuter, 1983.</p>

    <article> <p>Hello.</p>
<p>My name is Rendall. I am a software developer, father and New York City expatriot living in Finland, so this blog will revolve around these topics. This is a quick introductory post to say hello and set intentions for the blog.</p>
<p>The first intention is to free my thoughts to the bright light of extrospection, to let myself and others see what lies accreted there. Whether interesting, boring, odd, illuminating, useful, insightful, or trite: all will be revealed.</p>
<p>The second is to commit to committing; never to stealth edit a post, but clearly denote any changes; to be upfront about previous and ongoing mistakes, unwarranted convictions, blunders, misapprehensions and peculiar notions.</p>
<p>The third is to write more.</p>
<p>These intentions are for me, and not for you, dear reader. If I quietly correct a typo, for instance, and you drag me for violating my second intention, I will tell you to stuff it.</p>
<p>This blog is a bit of a continuation of <a href="https://rendallkoski.blogspot.com/">another</a>, but since I am taking ownership of the hosting, coding and designing of this one, it feels like a clean break and true start.</p>
