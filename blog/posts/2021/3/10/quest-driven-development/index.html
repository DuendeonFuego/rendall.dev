          <em>Quest Driven Development</em> is an expressive approach to writing
          game stories and interactive fiction that leaves coding and
          implementation to software, so writers can focus on narrative and
          world-building. This approach can highlight inconsistencies or
          problems as potentially clashing narrative branches are woven
          together, allowing a writer to correct errors or inconsistencies as
          they go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently <em>Quest Driven Development</em> is in the concept phase,
          but the problem and solution space is generally well understood. This
          post is a brief overview of its ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach itself and infrastructure tooling is

        </h2>
        <p>
          Story-rich games, interactive fiction, branching narratives of all
          sorts including even bog-standard fetch quests all have the same
          underlying abstract structure. Leveraging principles from theory and
          practice in other areas of software development can improve the
          design, writing and programming of branching narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          A branching narrative creator can, using
          <em>Quest Driven Development</em>, focus on the over-arching story,
          narrowing in on story details as needed, all while leaving actual
          implementation details such as variable values, error checks and
          if-then conditionals to software infrastructure and tooling.
        </p>
        <p>When mature, this approach allows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            automatically testing the narrative structure for errors and
            incompletable states;
          </li>
          <li>
            tracking narrative events and their consequences in world-building;
          </li>
          <li>visualizing the narrative structure as a whole or in part;</li>
          <li>
            interactively navigating and &quot;getting a feel for&quot; the
            narrative structure without needing to encode changes into the game
            platform;
          </li>
          <li>
            automatic code generation using the narrative itself as a template,
            rather than programming the narrative by hand;
          </li>
          <li>enable porting of game narratives into different platforms;</li>
          <li>
            data-gathering about the popularity and difficulty of various
            narrative structures.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As time goes on and the approach matures even further, it should be
          possible to procedurally generate coherent, unique branching narrative
          structures, for nearly infinite narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the similar structures that quests share with well-understood
          problems in software development, current best practices and solutions
          to these problems can be leveraged to handle or even solve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a minor point, a <em>quest</em> is a goal-oriented subset of the
          general <em>branching narrative</em>, but
          <em>Quest Driven Development</em> itself can apply to any style of
          branching narrative, not only quests.
          <em>Quest Driven Development</em> is however a snappier name than
          <em>Branching Narrative Driven Development</em>

          Quests and branching narratives in general correspond to some
          well-understood mathematical constructs in mathematics and computer
          science. If this does not interest you in the least, feel free to skip

          is an idea from computer science, an abstract machine which has a
          specific number of <em>states</em>. A

          can here entirely describe the player's position along a narrative arc
          as the result of any past decisions or actions. Some of the possible
          decisions at a given state will <em>transition</em> the narrative arc
          from the current state to another state. In this way, a quest can be
          described as a finite state machine (or, rather, this essay applies
          only to those interactive narratives that fit the structure of a
          finite state machine). A <em>terminal state</em> for our purposes is a
          state that ends, or narratively concludes, the quest.

        <p>
          A finite state machine, and therefore a quest, can be described as a
          directed graph, where <em>nodes</em> of the graph are <em>states</em>,
          and <em>edges</em> of the graph are specific actions or decisions
          which transition the quest from one state to the next. This is
          wonderful news, because graphs, finite state machines, and therefore
          quests, have available an intuitive visualization and a rich knowledge
          base for reasoning about them.

        <p>
          A finite state machine can be entirely described by a regular
          expression. This is a minor point that may not be useful for
          <em>writing</em> quests, but may be useful for
          <em>testing</em> quests. What this would mean in practice is that a
          regular expression engine could be leveraged to test whether any given
          sequence of actions would lead to an ending (or
          <em>terminal state</em>).

          A <em>state</em> as described above can roughly correspond to a scene
          in a play or an episode in a long-arc TV series: the scenario the
          characters find themselves in are due to the result of all previous
          decisions, and the <em>transition</em> corresponds to decisions or
          actions that move characters into new scenarios. A narrative
          constructed with this structure can leverage the theory outlined above
          <em>and</em> the practices outlined below.

          As an <em>approach</em> rather than as a specific software solution,
          <em>Quest Driven Development</em> can accommodate all manner of
          writing styles and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the abstract, a branching narrative writer will need an interface
          that outputs structured data objects which in turn are consumed by
          either an interpreter, compiler, testing platform or other game
          development platform. The actual nature of the development environment
          is flexible and can accommodate any sort of file format, from Word and
          text files, to spreadsheets, dynamic forms and widgets, to visual
          programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practically, the structured data for a single scene of a larger
          narrative would look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre

        <p>
          Software can consume and use such objects to map out the narrative
          structure, test it and even transform it into cold, hard code.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The consequences of decisions can overlap and interfere with each
          other. In a large game, a narrative can become inconsistent: a
          decision made by the player may not be reflected in the game state
          later, and almost never in conversation with a minor character at any
          point. Worse, certain quests or the game itself may
          <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=quest+incompletable&amp;ia=web"
            >enter into an incompletable state</a
          >, infuriating and disappointing players.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood, a state is a collection of variables and their values,
          and a transition is a change to the value of one or more of these
          variables. Manipulating values directly is to transition unpredictably
          in an unmapped, unexplored state machine. Keeping track of all of
          these values so that they behave in an expected and consistent way is
          called <em>state management</em>, and there are approaches to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <em>Quest Driven Development</em>, the writer is encouraged to
          think of state not as a collection of variable-values, but as a
          branching-point in an narrative. Transitions are not to be thought of
          as changes to variables, but as possible decisions by the player that
          advance the story.

          The internet is replete with plaintive posts from disappointed or
          infuriated players who cannot complete a quest or an entire game
          because of a broken quest. Quest Driven Development allows the
          narrative structure to be automatically explored and tested, flagging
          potential errors and inconsistencies. The narrative structure can be
          developed and tested in parallel and distinct from the underlying game
          platform.

          X Driven Development
          <a class="direct-link" href="#x-driven-development">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Generally, <em>X</em> Driven Development (e.g.
          <em>Test Driven Development</em>,
          <em>Behavior Driven Development</em>,
          <em>Feature Driven Development</em>) are approaches to
          <em>software</em> development that emphasize the <em>X</em> part,
          usually by crafting the development environment so that the
          <em>X</em> can be written or developed first. In <em>Test</em> Driven
          Development, developers write tests that fail, and then write software
          so that the test will pass. Similarly, in <em>Behavior</em> Driven
          Development, development teams decide what behavior the software
          should have and write <em>expressive</em> synopses of this behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantages of this approach is that the application has a series
          of automated tests that describe what the software should do, and
          importantly, can identify immediately when later additions to the
          software introduces bugs.

        <p>
          Likewise, <em>Quest Driven Development</em> emphasizes the stories
          that a game wants to tell. As the game progresses, a series of quest
          objects are created that can be continually tested against, to ensure
          that later additions are coherent, potential bugs or narrative
          consistencies are highlighted, and
